# NeuronNetwork
The Neuron Network consists of two inputs x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> which pass into neurons h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub>.
The outputs produced by h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub> act as the inputs for neuron o<sub>1</sub>, which then produces a final output,
as shown in the Figure below:
