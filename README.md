# NeuronNetwork
The Neuron Network consists of two inputs x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> (input layer) which pass into neurons h<sub>1</sub> (hidden layer) and h<sub>2</sub> (output layer).
The outputs produced by h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub> act as the inputs for neuron o<sub>1</sub>, which then produces a final output,
as shown in the Figure below:

To predict the output value g(x) in terms of inputs, we use Kolmogorov Theorem (1957) such that every continous function g:[0,1]<sup>p</sup> &#8594 <span>‚Ñù</span>
